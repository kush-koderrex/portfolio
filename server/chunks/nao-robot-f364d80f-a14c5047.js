<p>These days, developers are highly likely to be working on a mobile or web application. Python doesn\u2019t have built-in mobile development capabilities, but there are packages you can use to create mobile applications, like Kivy, PyQt, or even Beeware\u2019s Toga library.</p>
<p>These libraries are all major players in the Python mobile space. However, there are some benefits you\u2019ll see if you choose to create mobile applications with Kivy. Not only will your application look the same on all platforms, but you also won\u2019t need to compile your code after every change. What\u2019s more, you\u2019ll be able to use Python\u2019s clear syntax to build your applications.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn how to:</p>
<ul><li>Work with Kivy widgets</li>
<li>Lay out the UI</li>
<li>Add events</li>
<li>Use the KV language</li>
<li>Create a calculator application</li>
<li>Package your application for iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS</li></ul>
